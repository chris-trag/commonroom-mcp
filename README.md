# Common Room MCP Server

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is an unofficial MCP server for Common Room

Here's a self-hosted MCP for integrating the Common Room API with Amazon Q CLI and Claude Code. The goal is to be able to ask questions and make updates easily for your own instance. Hope this makes it easier to keep your activities, segments, and organizations up to date! ü•≥

## How It Works

This MCP server exposes Common Room API functionality as tools that Q CLI can use:

1. **MCP Protocol**: Server communicates with Q CLI via Model Context Protocol
2. **Tool Registration**: Each Common Room API endpoint becomes a callable tool
3. **Authentication**: Uses your Common Room API key from environment variables
4. **JSON Responses**: All data returned as formatted JSON for easy reading

    style D fill:#10b981,stroke:#000,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
```

When you ask Q CLI or Claude Code to "get Common Room activity types", it:
1. Calls the `commonroom_get_activity_types` tool
2. Server makes API request to Common Room
3. Returns formatted results to Q CLI
4. The agent presents the data to you in context

## Quick Setup

1. **Clone/download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configure environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key
4. **Configure MCP client** (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions)

### Claude Code
Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "commonroom": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/commonroom-mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {"COMMONROOM_KEY": "${COMMONROOM_KEY}"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Q CLI
```bash
q chat --mcp-config ~/.config/amazon-q/mcp-config.json
```

**üìñ [Complete Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)**

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/commonroom-mcp
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your API credentials:
   # COMMONROOM_KEY=your_api_token_here
   # COMMONROOM_BASE_URL=https://app.commonroom.io/community/your-community-id
   ```

3. **Test server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
